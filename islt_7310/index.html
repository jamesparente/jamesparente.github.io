        <h3>Purpose, Goals, and Objectives</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we will be using Photoshop to create a puzzle out of one of your own images. For this assignment, we will be using simple rectangular shapes as cut outs for the puzzle. The puzzle will be broken up into four or more pieces. We will go through a step-by-step example. There is also a YouTube tutorial video that covers the steps of the process. You can follow along with your own file. In this lesson, you will gain an understanding of using layers in Photoshop including special fx like drop shadows and strokes. Layer transformations including moving, scaling and rotating individual layer will also be covered. We will also explore basic selection tools along with utilizing rulers and guides. File management including saving and exporting different file types and shortcut keys will be reviewed as well.
