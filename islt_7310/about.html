        <h3>A little about me</h3>

        <p>Hello, my name is Jim Parente. I have an <b>MFA</b> in computer art from <em>Savannah College of Art and Design</em>. My undergraduate degree is in electrical engineering from <em>Worcester Polytechnic Institute</em>. I have been teaching digital media and animation for about 6 years now. Prior to teaching, I worked as a visual fx artist on animated and live action features. 
        <br> 
        I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in learning technologies and design at the <b>University of Missouri</b>. The program is completely online and offered through the School of Information Science & Learning Technologies in the College of Education. I intend on specializing in serious gaming and simulation design. My anticipated graduation date is spring of 2023.</p>
