    Hello. My name is Jim Parente. I live near Philadelphia and I teach digital media. I just started the master's degree in learning technologies. I have a little experience with website builders like Wix. I am hoping to build a website for my class using HTML/CSS. In my free time, I try to get away from my computer as much as possible.
