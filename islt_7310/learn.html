<h3>1. Using selection tools</h3>
<p>While working in photoshop, it is important to know the quality and size of the photo
    you are working and the expected output files type. You can use your own file or the
    example file. We will make sure the file is manageable by checking the image
    properties before we begin. We will save a working file and get started. We want to
    use guides to help cut up the image into pieces. To do this, we’ll turn on rulers and
    drag out some guides. Once we have the guides, we’ll use the rectangle marquee
    to easily select each piece of the original image.

<h3>2. Working with layers</h3>
<p>Layers are an integral part of Photoshop’s power. Image editing, compositing and
    effects can be achieved by stacking various elements together. Layers can be
    moved, copied, deleted, & grouped. Masks can be applied to hide or show different
    areas of a layer. Transparency can used to reveal the layer below. On a single
    screen display, the layer panel is typically found on the right side of the screen. If
    your computer supports multiple screens, you can configure your workspace to your
    linking. In this example we will be copying and pasting new layers, creating a
    background layer, renaming layers and rearranging the stacking order of the layers.

<h3>3. Staging and saving </h3>
<p>It’s now time to put the finishing touches on the puzzle. We will first enlarge the
canvas size to give us some more room to work. We’ll add a new background
layer and fill it with color that we can edit at any time. Next, we’ll transform (rotate
and move) our layers to style the scene, placing pieces on top of each other and
rearranging the layers if needed. This is a good time to tweak the stroke color and
shadows as well. Once we’re happy with our artwork it’s time to save and export
our files. We will save the file first as a Photoshop file. This file will retain all the
layers and fx created so far. This file type can only be viewed in Photoshop. To
share the output with others, we’ll also export a jpg file. This file will be a single layer
image that can be viewed on most devices.

<h3>4. Adding fx
</h3>
<p>Layer fx are quite useful. They can be applied non-destructively. This means that the
    attributes can be changed or removed at any time. The fx can be toggled on or off
    as well. Multiple fx can be used on the same layer. Fx can also be copied from one
    layer to another. Layer fx are accessed at the bottom of the layer panel. Once
    applied you can also double click the fx to open fx window editor. In this floating
    window, you can cycle through and edit all the fx options. For this example we will be
    using the drop shadow and stroke fx.
